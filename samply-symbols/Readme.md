# profiler-get-symbols

This is the "library" part of the [`profiler-get-symbols` workspace](https://github.com/mstange/profiler-get-symbols/).
This crate exposes three functions: `get_compact_symbol_table`, `get_symbolication_result`
and `query_api`. These functions allow various consumers to obtain symbol information.
